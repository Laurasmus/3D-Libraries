# 3D-Libraries
Library for 3D Representation of Scientific Data for Research in Nanolectronics with Blender


In this project we have developed two libraries for 3D Representation of Scientific Data for two research lines carried out in the Electronics Department of the University of Granada. One of them is done in collaboration with CNM Barcelona (National Centre for Microelectronics) and the other one with the University of Leeds (United Kingdom).

We used free software tools and have generated a series of scripts tailored to the needs of the researcher. Throughout the project we have made interviews with both clients to know what requirements should have the final product and the result of our work is a scientific video generated automatically.
