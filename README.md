Library for 3D Representation of Scientific Data for Research in Nanolectronics with Blender


In this project I developed a set of scripts in Python to be used in Blender for automatic generation of graphical representation of data coming from simulations in the field of nanoelectronics. We worked on programming libraries for the representation of wave functions in semiconductor quantum dots, data provided by the University of Leeds (United Kingdom) within an international research collaboration. We also worked in the representation of the set process and thermal distribution in resistive RAM memories made of HfO2 simulated in the Electronics Department of University of Granada and measured in CNM Barcelona (National Centre for Microelectronic in Barcelona).
